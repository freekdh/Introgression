Experimental papers:
-   Graham Bell and Andres Gonzalez (2009)              Evolutionary rescue can prevent extinction following environmental change
    Experimentally show the U-shaped curve of evolutionary rescue and 
    that population size of yeast increases the probability of rescue and
    sufficiently large population could contain enough useful variation to recover by natual selection
-   Lenski and Bennett (1992)


Theory papers:

-   Maynard Smith 1989                                  ??
    It's a race: adaptation must occur before the population becomes extinct.

-   Gomulkiewicz and Holt (1995)                        When does evolution by NS prevent extinction ?
    Quantitative trait with explicit population density model gets rescued depending on
    Initial population size vs. degree of maladaptaion (variance of phenotypic trait and fitness + distance of means)
-   Lynch and Lande 1993 
-   Lynch 1996 for review
-   Orr and Unckless (2008)                             Population Extinction and the genetics of adaptation
    Calculate the probabilities of rescue when the population is declining using branching processes
    Do this for standing genetic variation and new mutations.
    The point is: agree with Gomulkiewicz and Holt: unless populations are very large or suffer modest decrease, adaptation can be difficult
